"""Example DAG: Deferrable sensor in push mode.

Demonstrates RMQSensor with ``mode="push"`` — the triggerer subscribes to the
queue via AMQP ``basic_consume`` and the broker delivers messages instantly as
they arrive, without polling delay.

When to use push vs pull
------------------------
* **push** — prefer when low latency matters (payment events, real-time alerts)
  or when the queue is mostly idle and polling would waste connections.
* **pull** (default) — prefer when simplicity is more important than latency,
  or when filter logic causes many NACKs (see quorum queue note below).

Quorum queue warning (RabbitMQ 4.0+)
--------------------------------------
When non-matching messages are NACKed with ``requeue=True``, RabbitMQ 4.0+
enforces a default redelivery limit of **20** for quorum queues. After 20
redeliveries the message is dead-lettered or dropped. If heavy filtering is
expected, consider using a dedicated queue for the specific message type or
increasing the ``delivery-limit`` policy on the queue.

message_wait_timeout
--------------------
The optional ``message_wait_timeout`` sets how long (in seconds) the trigger
waits for a matching message before giving up with a ``RuntimeError``. The
actual wait may slightly exceed this value while the AMQP consumer is cancelled
gracefully (``basic_cancel`` round-trip to the broker).
``None`` (default) means wait indefinitely — the sensor's own ``timeout``
parameter still applies at the DAG level.

    ### Push Mode Sensor Example

    Uses `deferrable=True` with `mode="push"` — the broker delivers messages
    instantly via `basic_consume` instead of periodic polling.

    Key differences from the deferrable pull mode:
    - No `poll_interval` delay — message is processed as soon as it arrives.
    - Optional `message_wait_timeout` limits how long to wait for a message.
    - `filter_callable` is NOT supported (same as all deferrable modes).
